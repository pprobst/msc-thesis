* Abstract
In a planning task, an agent must choose the most appropriate action from a potentially large set of actions at each step. Logic-based (or symbolic-based) planners use preferred operators to reduce the number of actions significantly. This work presents a method for sampling and learning preferred operators, aiming for their applicability across the entire state space of a planning task. We demonstrate that these learned preferred operators have close results compared to the current best logic-based approach. Our objective is to identify ideal preferred operators, which are situated along the shortest paths leading to some goal. However, due to the huge size of search state spaces, we introduce a novel sampling strategy tailored for extracting preferred operators. Our research shows that high-quality preferred operators can be obtained from a sample set covering only a fraction of the state space. To gain insights into this new category of preferred operators, we conduct controlled experiments: we systematically compare them to baselines, evaluate the effectiveness of preferred operators learned from several sample sizes, and assess their performance when combined with different heuristic functions.
